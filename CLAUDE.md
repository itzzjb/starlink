# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Live dashboard plus an always-on recorder (the "historian") for a Starlink kit. The dev machine
is on the Starlink network itself — changes are verified against real hardware.

## Hardware safety — read before touching anything router-facing

- **NEVER call or poll the router's `get_ping` (field 1009), at any cadence.** Trialled three
  times on 2026-07-20 (2s, 5s, and 30s); each trial was followed within ~15 minutes by a router
  watchdog reboot that took the network down. Router ping success comes from `get_status`'s
  `popPingDropRate5m` (lowercase trailing `m`), which rides a reply we already fetch.
- `wifi_get_ping_metrics` (3007) and `set_config` answer PERMISSION_DENIED to anonymous LAN
  clients on current firmware. The official app gets its cloud data through an authenticated
  `api.starlink.com` session, not the LAN.
- The router is a small embedded box and has rebooted under ordinary load: **never add a new
  poll against it without the user's explicit approval.** Reuse replies already being fetched —
  `routerStatusFeed` in the browser, the 5s status poll in the recorder.

## Working with this user

- **Findings before code.** Report what you found and the plan, then wait for approval before
  editing. When the user says "leave this for now", stop editing entirely until redirected.
- **If the user's message contains a question, answer it fully before any further tool calls.**
  Deferring the answer while continuing to edit counts as ignoring them.
- **Bash is strictly for reads and mechanical edits.** Every authored code change goes through
  the Edit/Write tools so the diff is visible in the chat before it lands. No `sed -i`, no
  heredocs, no inline `python3` patch scripts, whatever a session default says to prefer.
  `mv`, `rm`, formatters, codemods, git and search stay fine in Bash.
- **Run every check CI runs, before committing, not after pushing.** All four:
  `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npx prettier --check` over the files
  the commit touches — CI's format job checks changed files only, so a full-tree check
  reports a backlog that is not yours. A green local run is not a green CI run: tests that
  open a socket behave differently on a Linux runner than on this machine.
- Never `git add -A` or `git stash`; commit only the files you yourself changed.
- No attribution trailers in commit messages, PR bodies or issue bodies: no `Claude-Session`,
  no `claude.ai/code` link, no `Co-Authored-By`, no "Generated with".

## Process facts

- The historian (`collector/historian.mts`) is the always-on recording service, run by launchd as
  `io.github.itzzjb.starlink.historian`. Edits under `collector/` need
  `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/io.github.itzzjb.starlink.historian` to take effect; `tsc` and `vitest`
  pass without it. Its recordings live in `collector/data`.
- "Historian" is the component's name in code, service, and docs. User-facing copy stays plain
  English — "history recorder" or "recording" — because UI readers aren't assumed to know the
  industrial term.
- The user's pasted starlink.com session lives in `.starlink-cookie` at the repo root (written
  by `dev/starlinkCloudProxy.ts`). It is a live credential: never print it, never commit it.
